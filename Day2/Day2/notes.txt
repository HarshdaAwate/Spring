for every bean id a new objct would be created by SC and it would happen by default during SC loading or initilization phase
when you ask for same bean id again and gain SC will always return same object

<!-- Employee emp1 = new Employee(); -->
<bean id="emp1" class="com.met.model.Employee" scope="singleton"></bean>
 	
 	<!-- Employee emp2 = new Employee(); -->
 	<bean id="emp2" class="com.met.model.Employee"></bean>
